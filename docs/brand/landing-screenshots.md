# Real Métis interface captures

Captured on 2026-11-13 from the actual React application in `src/`, running through the existing Vite development backend at implementation base `d8d3ef5ef`. These are not images generated with AI, UI mockups, or captures of the landing demos.

## Capture conditions

- Safari, 1460 × 949 CSS-pixel window at 2× resolution. Original PNGs: 2920 × 1898.
- Dedicated loopback server on port 5203 and a disposable vault containing 9 authored demonstration notes plus 5 type definitions. No personal notes appear in these images.
- UI language: Portuguese (Brazil), light theme. Git and AI features disabled in this demonstration.
- Server CSP: `connect-src 'self' ws://127.0.0.1:5203 ws://localhost:5203`, blocking the personal MCP/AI bridge and external connections from the capture page.
- The development backend reads these Markdown files. Screenshots demonstrate the real editor, note relationships/properties and spreadsheet renderer; they do not verify or represent native macOS integration, Git history, sync or AI execution.
- Images were captured through computer use. Only the top 180 pixels of Safari chrome were cropped. Application content, development badge, actual labels and formatting were preserved. Full-size WebP assets use lossless encoding; 960-pixel variants are resized and compressed for the landing.

## Views

- `metis-editor.webp`: editor with a note, links, quote and checklist.
- `metis-connections.webp`: note neighborhood list and properties/backlinks panel. This is a list of relationships, not a visual node graph.
- `metis-spreadsheet.webp`: sheet note with formula results, including the calculated total of 168 pages.

## Provenance

Originals and the disposable vault remain outside Git under this local capture session:

# Contributing to Métis

Report bugs and propose changes in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hdoria/metis/issues). Search existing issues first. For a bug, include the platform, build, steps to reproduce, expected result and actual result. Remove note contents, credentials and other private information from diagnostics.

Keep pull requests focused on one change. Explain the problem, the behavior after the change, and how you tested it. Follow the repository's [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), reuse existing components, and keep visible text in the locale catalogs.

Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build` and the relevant tests before submitting. Native changes also need Rust verification. Test with a disposable vault, never a real user's files.

The project is distributed under AGPL-3.0-or-later. Preserve attribution notices and check the licenses of any new dependencies. Do not add external telemetry, signing or deployment credentials to the repository.
